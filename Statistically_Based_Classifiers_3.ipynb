    "A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents feature(or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. The topmost node in a decision tree is known as the root node. It learns to partition on the basis of the attribute value. It partitions the tree in recursively manner call recursive partitioning. This flowchart-like structure helps you in decision making. It's visualization like a flowchart diagram which easily mimics the human level thinking. That is why decision trees are easy to understand and interpret.\n",

    "Decision Tree is a white box type of ML algorithm. It shares internal decision-making logic, which is not available in the black box type of algorithms such as Neural Network. Its training time is faster compared to the neural network algorithm. The time complexity of decision trees is a function of the number of records and number of attributes in the given data. The decision tree is a distribution-free or non-parametric method, which does not depend upon probability distribution assumptions. Decision trees can handle high dimensional data with good accuracy.\n",

    "How does the Decision Tree algorithm work?\n",
    "The basic idea behind any decision tree algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select the best attribute using Attribute Selection Measures(ASM) to split the records.\n",
    "2. Make that attribute a decision node and breaks the dataset into smaller subsets.\n",
    "3. Starts tree building by repeating this process recursively for each child until one of the condition will match:\n",
    "- All the tuples belong to the same attribute value.\n",
    "- There are no more remaining attributes.\n",
    "- There are no more instances\n",

    "Attribute Selection Measures\n",
    "Attribute selection measure is a heuristic for selecting the splitting criterion that partition data into the best possible manner. It is also known as splitting rules because it helps us to determine breakpoints for tuples on a given node. ASM provides a rank to each feature(or attribute) by explaining the given dataset. Best score attribute will be selected as a splitting attribute (Source). In the case of a continuous-valued attribute, split points for branches also need to define. Most popular selection measures are Information Gain, Gain Ratio, and Gini Index.\n",

    "<b>Information Gain</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Shannon invented the concept of entropy, which measures the impurity of the input set. In physics and mathematics, entropy referred as the randomness or the impurity in the system. In information theory, it refers to the impurity in a group of examples. Information gain is the decrease in entropy. Information gain computes the difference between entropy before split and average entropy after split of the dataset based on given attribute values. ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser) decision tree algorithm uses information gain.\n",

For instance, consider an attribute with a unique identifier such as customer_ID has zero info(D) because of pure partition. This maximizes the information gain and creates useless partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "C4.5, an improvement of ID3, uses an extension to information gain known as the gain ratio. Gain ratio handles the issue of bias by normalizing the information gain using Split Info. Java implementation of the C4.5 algorithm is known as J48, which is available in WEKA data mining tool.\n",
